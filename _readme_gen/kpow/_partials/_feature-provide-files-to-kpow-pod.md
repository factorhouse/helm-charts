There are occasions where you must provide files to the Kpow Pod in order for Kpow to run correctly, such files include:

- RBAC configuration
- SSL Keystores
- SSL Truststores

How you provide these files is down to user preference, we are not able to provide any support or instruction in this
regard.

You may find the Kubernetes documentation on [injecting data into applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/distribute-credentials-secure/#create-a-pod-that-has-access-to-the-secret-data-through-a-volume) useful.
