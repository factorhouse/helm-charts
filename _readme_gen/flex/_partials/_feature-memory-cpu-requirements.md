The chart runs Flex with Guaranteed QoS, having resource request and limit set to these values by default:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 2
    memory: 8Gi
  requests:
    cpu: 2
    memory: 8Gi
```

These default resource settings are conservative, suited to a deployment of Flex that manages multiple Flink clusters
and associated resources.

When running Flex with a single Flink cluster you can experiment with reducing those resources as far as our suggested
minimum:

#### Minimum Resource Requirements

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 1
    memory: 2Gi
  requests:
    cpu: 1
    memory: 2Gi
```
